# Hello!

This is a very basic Python console app that pulls osu! stat information using osu!'s API v1.\
When using the program, your personal API key is stored in plaintext in the api.txt file.\
Be sure not to share this key with anyone, since it's as important as your password.

You can initialize the script by opening cmd at the destination folder address and entering "python main.py"
